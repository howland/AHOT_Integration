Welcome to the AHOT integration wiki. This is where the developers currently working with the integration of 2d- and 3d- spatial solver modules in pyne can track meeting notes, outline a wrapping strategy, and post resources to one another in a version-controlled manner.    
***

The timeline and overall goals for the project are [here](./Timeline-&-Goals)

Notes from various meetings can be found [here](./Meeting-Notes)

[Working Notes](./Working-Notes) includes updates and notes on various topics, including:
* [Building Sebastian's Codes](./Working-Notes#SSummary)
* [Converting transport files to compile with gnu](./Working-Notes#gnu_build)

[Issues](./Issues) is a page to bring up current development issues that need resolution. After resolution they can be documented on the [Working Notes](./Working-Notes) page.

[Fortran Wrapping Resources](./Fortran-Wrapping-Resources) includes links and resources for a number of wrapping options that have been explored.
