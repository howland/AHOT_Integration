[located in /usr/local/pynehive - you should have rwx access (associated with group pyne)] 
[note: Rachel wote extensive comments about how code works in inp4_comments in test directory]

- write directions for compiling and building codes; determine which build already and which don't 
[directions and summary are in the next entry in notebook]

_For the meeting in 2 weeks:_

1. code interface (inp4 in test_inps + thesis) summary; API plan [Josh + Madicken]

2. email to group -> file structure, C++ or Python API? [Josh + Rachel] 
[done; directly to Python API]

3. Python wrapping plan finalization (based on need for C++ or Python) [Josh + Madicken]

4. bashrc [Madicken]
